## Welcome

The Calvin Religious Modeling Research Group is a multidisciplinary initiative at [Calvin University](https://calvin.edu/){target="_blank"} dedicated to advancing computational modeling approaches to understand religious phenomena, faith-based behaviors, and their intersection with social dynamics.

## Our Mission

We investigate how computational models can illuminate the complex dynamics of religious communities, belief formation, and faith-based decision-making. Our work bridges computer science, sociology, psychology, and theology to provide evidence-based insights into religious life and practice.

## Research Areas

-   **Agent-Based Modeling of Religious Communities**: Studying how beliefs, practices, and values spread within and between religious groups
-   **Computational Models of Faith Formation**: Understanding the processes by which individuals develop and change their religious beliefs
-   **Social Network Analysis in Religious Contexts**: Examining the role of relationships and community structures in religious life
-   **Behavioral Modeling of Religious Practices**: Investigating how religious beliefs influence behavior and decision-making
-   **Interfaith Dynamics**: Modeling interactions between different religious traditions and their impact on social cohesion

## Leadership

**Eric Ara√∫jo**, Associate Professor\
[Computer Science Department](https://calvin.edu/academics/school-stem/computer-science){target="_blank"}, Calvin University\
Head of the Behavioural Informatics Laboratory (BILbo)

-   PhD in Computer Science, [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/nl){target="_blank"}, The Netherlands, 2018
-   Expertise in multiagent modeling, complex systems, and social dynamics

## Collaboration

Our research group welcomes collaboration with scholars from diverse fields including theology, sociology, psychology, anthropology, and computer science. We believe that understanding religious phenomena requires interdisciplinary approaches that respect both scientific rigor and the complexity of faith.
